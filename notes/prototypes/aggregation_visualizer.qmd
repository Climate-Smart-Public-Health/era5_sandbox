Let's do a quick visualization dashboard for the downloaded
data for QA purposes and learning how to manipulate spatial features
data.

## Testing

First let's make sure we know how to do this in R in general:

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(terra)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
```

```{r}
nc_files <- here("data/input") %>%
    list.files(full.names=TRUE)
```
